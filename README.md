# EcoCommons Notebook Blog Site

This repository hosts files used to build the EcoCommons Notebook Blog Site (https://EcoCommonsAustralia.github.io/notebook-blog/).

For the notebooks themself, please visit https://github.com/EcoCommonsAustralia/notebooks

Tips for people who render this quarto website:

1. Render the whole site when things that have impact on every page like footer.html, index.qmd/html changed.
2. For page that downloads big dataset, maybe download it for the first time, then comment out the code chunk downloading data.
3. If you want to change the foot.html, please go to the https://github.com/EcoCommonsAustralia/ec-notebook_site_materials/blob/main/footer.qmd to download it, make change, and render it to footer.html and replace the old one in this repo.
